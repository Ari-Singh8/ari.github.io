        Hi, I'm Ari, I am currently 17 and in my senior year at Kettering Fairmont High School.
        I'm currently in their IT program, where I've learned about computer hardware, javascript, html, and css over the
        2 years ive been in it.
        I've been doing cross country since freshman year and have improved vastly during my time running.
        I started with my first race having a time of 33:00 and have cut it down to 22:00.
        I also lead a leadership role as part of my senior year of cross country.
    </p>

        My other hobbies include working out.
        I've been going to the gym on my own time after school since summer of my junior year.
        Usually i cut workouts into 3 different days.
        I have back and biceps, chest and triceps, and legs as my workout days.
        Currently I'm nearly able to do my body weight on most exercises for multiple reps.
    </p>

    <p>
        Aside from that I also enjoy playing video games and hanging out with friends.
        My favorite game to play with my friends is "SCP: Secret Laboratory".
        I am also currently trying to learn music production using ableton.
        Music is one of my favorite pieces of media and I've received much inspiration from it.
        Some of my favorite artists are Bladee, Sematary, and Jane Remover.
